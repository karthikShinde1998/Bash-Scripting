Chapter 1 : Shebang

The Shebang ( #! ) is used to tell the OS where the interpreter is.

#!/bin/bash tells the computer where to  find the bash interpreter

similarly,
  #!/usr/bin/python3 tells the system where to find the pythion interpreter 
  with which the system can execute the instructions in this File.

  Refer to the Python_code file in this Folder.
 
  After adding the [chmod +x] rights to the File,
  It can be easily executed using ./Python_code  instead of the traditional python3 Python_code.py (also note you dont need to add extension .py to the file if you
  mention the path using Shebank and execute as ./ )
